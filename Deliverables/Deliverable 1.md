# "Software Project Plan Document" Outline 

### 1) Introduction -- Elif Sahin

  #### Project statement and objectives
  Individuals may have multiple tasks to complete and want to organize them. They can be a project manager, an operation manager, a student with a busy schedule, a financial analyst, or even a person who is working full time and also trying to organize their time to cook, do laundry, or any type of housework. This organization would be done by writing on a post-it or a piece of paper in the past. However, with technology evolving, it can be done by creating a word document, putting the task in excel, or saving them to a phone's notes. The downside of these approaches are that it takes time, it’s hard to put the tasks in an order, and does not have self-reminders, the individual will have to track their document or notes to keep updated with what will come next. This project's objective is to develop a user-friendly, fast performing, and effective to-do list website that lets users prioritize, arrange their tasks, and improve their time and task management skills.
  
  #### Major functions
  1. Users can create a task, edit it, and mark it complete when the task is done.
  2. User can set reminders while creating their task.
  3. Users can put their tasks in different categories.
  4. Users can set deadlines for their tasks.
  5. Users can view their weekly and monthly dashboard that illustrates their process of completing tasks.
  6. Users can share their to-do list with different users.
  
  ####  Performance issues (if any)
  1. Users network speed
  2. Security issues 
  3. Requirement of servers
  4. Database optimization
  5. Syncronization with different platforms

### 5) Project Resources - Kyle Moran

  #### People
    We have our team to reach out to
    And as of the first week don't have anyone else to reach out to
  
  #### Hardware
    Each person should have there own computer and the ability to make a development server.
    We will need a server to host the website and the back-end
  
  #### Software
    We will be using github for source control
    Our frontend will use `React.js` as a component library
    The backend will use `Django` and `SQLite`

### 6) Activity Log - Brian Alvarez

  #### Reading time 
  01/31/2023: 60 minutes	
In the first meeting, the team reviewed the deliverable deadlines for the project and discussed the tasks required to remain on schedule for deliverable #1. Each team member chose one section from the seven sections (Introduction, Project Estimates, Project Risks, Schedule, Project Resources, Activity Log, and Appendices) needed for deliverable #1. The team also created the team’s Github page to collaborate and currently hold all project resources. On the GitHub page, the team created three folders: 

  Deliverables - This folder will hold our written reports for deliverables.
  
  Front-end - This folder will hold the files and code for our front-end development.
  
  Back-end - his folder will hold the files and code for our Back-end development.
  
Finally, the team shared numbers, connected, and reminded each other to complete their chosen deadline by the deliverable #1 deadline on 02/07/2023.

  #### Project time
The team spent 60 minutes completing the following:

  Reviewing the project and deliverable #1 requirements (45 minutes)
  
    Discussing requirements and delegating tasks (30 minutes)
    
    Discussing the best approach to the project (15 minutes)
    
      A few of the questions asked:
      
         Which development stack will be best for the project?
	 
         Where will the website be hosted? 
	 
         Which days will we meet and discuss updates?
	 
  Creating the Github Page, folders, and distribution of the link (15 minutes)
  
    Labeling sections and folders (5 minutes)
    
    Adding members and setting up the start of the project (10 minutes)
