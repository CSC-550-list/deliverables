# "Software Project Plan Document" Outline 

### 1) Introduction -- Elif Sahin

  #### Project statement and objectives
  Individuals may have multiple tasks to complete and want to organize them. They can be a project manager, an operation manager, a student with a busy schedule, a financial analyst, or even a person who is working full time and also trying to organize their time to cook, do laundry, or any type of housework. This organization would be done by writing on a post-it or a piece of paper in the past. However, with technology evolving, it can be done by creating a word document, putting the task in excel, or saving them to a phone's notes. The downside of these approaches are that it takes time, it’s hard to put the tasks in an order, and does not have self-reminders, the individual will have to track their document or notes to keep updated with what will come next. This project's objective is to develop a user-friendly, fast performing, and effective to-do list website that lets users prioritize, arrange their tasks, and improve their time and task management skills.
  
  #### Major functions
  1. Users can create a task, edit it, and mark it complete when the task is done.
  2. User can set reminders while creating their task.
  3. Users can put their tasks in different categories.
  4. Users can set deadlines for their tasks.
  5. Users can view their weekly and monthly dashboard that illustrates their process of completing tasks.
  6. Users can share their to-do list with different users.
  
  ####  Performance issues (if any)
  1. Users network speed
  2. Security issues 
  3. Requirement of servers
  4. Database optimization
  5. Syncronization with different platforms

### 3) Project Risks - Phillip Nikolov

  #### Risk identification
  
  With creating a website, there are multiple risks involved that we need to keep in mind and account for.

Some of these Risks include: 
1. Website performance
2. Scope creep, AKA changing requirements as the project progresses
3. Underestimation of time/resource commitment to complete the website
4. Attacks that could take down our website such as DDoS attacks
5. Attacks that attempt to alter data within the website such as SQL injections
6. Attacks that can steal user data and prevent the user from using the site
  
  #### Risk estimation
  
  Website performance could become an issue if the website becomes larger, or becomes used by more people than the server was meant to handle. This should not be a large issue for our purposes.

Scope creep can become an issue if multiple additional features get added to the project if the original planned project features have not been implemented yet. This can drag the project on longer than it needs to go.

Underestimation of time and bad time management will likely be the biggest issue of this project as this project could grow. Without proper management, work could be divided unevenly and not get completed as a result.

As for security, risk of a cyberattack is low, as this web application will likely not be used by many users, and this project will be relatively unknown outside of the development team. 
  
  #### Risk resolution
  
  If website performance becomes an issue, there are two possible solutions to improve the performance. First, is to modify the code to be more efficient in terms of time complexity, and the Second is to upgrade the server that the website is hosted on.

Scope Creep: If too many features become part of the project plan, then the schedule for implementing these featres will be altered to include all the important features that make the website run well before the deadline. Then and only then will extra features be added to the project if time permits.

Time management: In order to combat bad time management, a schedule will be created within the development group with a plan for every member of the group. This way, each developer will have their own part of the project and know what they need to do.

Security risks: In order to prevent attacks, developers will implement secure coding solutions to avoid vulnerabilities within the project.

### 5) Project Resources - Kyle Moran

  #### People
    We have our team to reach out to
    And as of the first week don't have anyone else to reach out to
  
  #### Hardware
    Each person should have there own computer and the ability to make a development server.
    We will need a server to host the website and the back-end
  
  #### Software
    We will be using github for source control
    Our frontend will use `React.js` as a component library
    The backend will use `Django` and `SQLite`

### 6) Activity Log - Brian Alvarez

  #### Reading time 
  01/31/2023: 60 minutes	

In the first meeting, the team reviewed the deliverable deadlines for the project and discussed the tasks required to remain on schedule for deliverable #1. Each team member chose one section from the seven sections (Introduction, Project Estimates, Project Risks, Schedule, Project Resources, Activity Log, and Appendices) needed for deliverable #1. The team also created the team’s Github page to collaborate and currently hold all project resources. On the GitHub page, the team created three folders: 

  Deliverables - This folder will hold our written reports for deliverables.
  
  Front-end - This folder will hold the files and code for our front-end development.
  
  Back-end - his folder will hold the files and code for our Back-end development.
  
Finally, the team shared numbers, connected, and reminded each other to complete their chosen deadline by the deliverable #1 deadline on 02/07/2023.
